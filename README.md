## ENG
The speech system contains 3 parts: speech synthesis, robot's response generation using a Large language model and speech synthesis of said response into audio. The speech system uses a 13 generation Intel Nuc for realtime speech recognition and running a speech synthesis model and a Nvidia Jetson Orin NX for running a quantized 7B Llama2 model to generate responses to the input.
